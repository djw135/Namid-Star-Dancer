I developed the intial game demo and added enemies. Currently working on creating a template in scripts that allows us to produce levels easily by giving access to "difficulty" values and keeping core data that persist through levels or scences -Justin

Created menu for the game and am currently working on a new scene to call inbetween levels to transition them - Devante

I have been working on developing new graphics for the game in Blender and Magica Voxel(mostly Blender) and am currently working on some issues partaining to the inegration of said graphics - Juan

I have been working on creating new audio files for the game such as background music and sound effects for various aspects - Josh


After Second Sprint on 11/8/17:

I have wrote all the core game scripts and and created many of the core game aspects such as enemies, hazards, lighting ext.. Currently working on producing more in depth levels while also using Josh's hazard spawn designs. -Justin

Created visual aspects of the menu and all scripts involved with menu management. Designed fade transitions inbetween scenes as well as wrote the script for it. Currenly working on addtional transitional scenes to place inbetween each level. -Devante

I have made numerous object and graphic files for the game, some including the player ship and the bolt model that shoots when the player fires. I am currently working on different astroid, player and weapon models. -Juan

Devloped menu and level music for the game as well as wrote numerous pattern based spawning methods for the hazards in the game to create a more "bullet hell" feel. I am currently working on integrating these patterns into a single gamecontroller so that we can use them in the same level for a boss encounter- Josh

After Third Sprint on 12/4/17

I have wrote all the core game scripts and and created many of the core game aspects such as enemies, hazards, lighting ext.. During this last sprint, I changed the enemy/hazaerd spawn patterns of each level, added a boss level, integrated music and graphics, added values such as player and boss hit  points and made them visible while also creating a boss ship game object that fires and interacts with the player in a number of ways. -Justin

Created visual aspects of the menu and all scripts involved with menu management. Designed fade transitions inbetween scenes as well as wrote the script for it. During this sprint, I created new backgrounds for each level including the boss fight, made the transitions between scenes smoother and polished the menu screen. -Devante

Made all the gameobject graphics that are in the game currently such as the player ship, enemy ship, astroids and bolts. During this sprint i helped intergate my new models and created some more astroids as well. I was working on some new weapon designs but we didnt have the logic coded for that yet. -Juan

Devloped menu and level music for the game as well as wrote numerous pattern based spawning methods for the hazards in the game to create a more "bullet hell" feel. During this sprint I wrote songs for each level and remade the menu songs for adding a total of 3 new songs. I also condensed my bullet hell scripts into one script with tighter logic and denser spawning for the boss level as well as helped integrate said script. -Josh
